# Azure Nuke

A powerful CLI tool for scanning and cleaning up Azure resources.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install aznuke

# Or clone the repository and install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/sojay/azure-nuke.git
cd azure-nuke
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Azure Nuke provides two main commands:

### Scan Command

The `scan` command identifies Azure resources according to specified criteria:

```bash
# Run a full scan
aznuke scan

# Scan a specific subscription and region
aznuke scan --profile production --region westus2

# Scan only Storage and VM resources
aznuke scan --checks storage,virtualmachines

# Export results as JSON
aznuke scan --output json > azure_report.json

# Show only high severity issues
aznuke scan --severity high

# Verbose output for debugging
aznuke scan -v
```

### Delete Command

The `delete` command removes Azure resources:

```bash
# Delete resources (with confirmation)
aznuke delete

# Delete specific resource types without confirmation
aznuke delete --checks storage,virtualmachines --yes

# Perform a dry run to see what would be deleted
aznuke delete --dry-run
```

## Options

### Global Options

- `--profile`: Azure subscription profile name
- `--region`: Azure region to target
- `--checks`: Comma-separated list of resource types
- `--config`: Path to exclusions configuration file
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output

### Scan-specific Options

- `--output`: Output format (text or json)
- `--severity`: Filter by severity level (low, medium, high)

### Delete-specific Options

- `--dry-run`: Preview resources that would be deleted without actually deleting
- `--protected-subscriptions`: List of subscription IDs that should not be modified
- `--yes, -y`: Skip confirmation prompt

## Configuration

Exclusions can be configured in `config/exclusions.yaml` to prevent certain resources from being included in scans or deletions. You can specify your own configuration file using the `--config` option.

### Exclusion Configuration Format

```yaml
# Exclude specific resource types
resource_types:
  - Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults  # Exclude all Key Vaults
  - Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts  # Exclude all Storage Accounts

# Exclude resources with names matching these patterns
name_patterns:
  - "^prod-.*$"  # Exclude resources with names starting with "prod-"
  - ".*-do-not-delete$"  # Exclude with names ending with "-do-not-delete"

# Exclude specific resource IDs
resource_ids:
  - "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/important-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/criticalaccount"

# Exclude resources with specified tags
tags:
  Environment: "Production"
  DoNotDelete: "true"
```

## Examples

```bash
# Scan all resources in the development subscription
aznuke scan --profile development

# Output scan results as JSON
aznuke scan --output json > scan_results.json

# Delete all storage accounts in westus2 region
aznuke delete --checks microsoft.storage/storageaccounts --region westus2

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
aznuke delete --checks microsoft.compute/virtualmachines --dry-run

# Delete resources with force, skipping confirmation
aznuke delete --yes

# Use a custom exclusions config file
aznuke scan --config my-exclusions.yaml
```
